  - Prevents overfitting on recent data

- **Training Script** (`src/trainer/train_hybrid.py`):
  - Configurable hyperparameters
  - Automatic checkpointing
  - Progress tracking and statistics
  - Multi-threaded C++ data generation

- **Performance**:

## Building

### Prerequisites
- CMake â‰¥ 3.15
- C++17 compiler
- pybind11 (installed via pip)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# From project root
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

# This creates mcts_cpp.cpython-39-darwin.so (or similar for your platform)
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run Phase 1 tests
python cpp/tests/test_bindings.py

# Should output:
# ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! Phase 1 milestone complete!
```

## Usage Examples

### Phase 1: Basic Data Structures

```python
import mcts_cpp

# Test basic functionality
print(mcts_cpp.hello_world())  # "Hello from C++!"

# Create training data structures
exp = mcts_cpp.Experience()
exp.state = [0.0] * 27   # 3x3x3 board state
exp.policy = [0.111] * 9  # Move probabilities
exp.value = 1.0           # Game outcome

# Create batch
batch = mcts_cpp.ExperienceBatch()
batch.experiences = [exp]
batch.total_games = 1
batch.player1_wins = 1
batch.player2_wins = 0
batch.draws = 0
```

### Phase 2: Game Logic and MCTS

```python
import mcts_cpp

# Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game
game = mcts_cpp.TicTacToe()

# Make some moves
game.make_move(0, 1)   # Player 1 at position 0
game.make_move(4, -1)  # Player -1 at position 4

# Check game state
board = game.get_board()
legal_moves = game.get_legal_moves()
winner = game.check_winner()

# Get canonical state (current player perspective)
canonical_state = game.get_canonical_state(player=1)

# Create MCTS with random policy
predictor = mcts_cpp.RandomPredictor()
mcts = mcts_cpp.MCTS(predictor, num_simulations=50, c_puct=2.0)

# Get action probabilities
action_probs = mcts.get_action_probs(game, player=1, temperature=1.0)

# Play a full self-play game
selfplay = mcts_cpp.SelfPlayGame(predictor, num_simulations=50)
experiences = selfplay.play_game()
result = selfplay.get_game_result()

print(f"Game completed: {len(experiences)} moves, result: {result}")
```

### Phase 3: Model Export and TorchScript

```python
# Step 1: Export a trained model to TorchScript
import subprocess

subprocess.run([
    "python", "src/trainer/export_model.py",
    "--input", "models/your_model.pth",
    "--output", "models/your_model.pt"
])

# Step 2: Use TorchScript model in Python
from trainer.torchscript_predictor import TorchScriptPredictor
import numpy as np

predictor = TorchScriptPredictor("models/your_model.pt")

# Single prediction
state = np.zeros(27, dtype=np.float32)
state[18:27] = 1.0  # Empty board
policy, value = predictor.predict(state)

print(f"Policy: {policy}")  # Shape: (9,)
print(f"Value: {value}")    # Float in [-1, 1]

# Batch prediction
states = np.random.randn(4, 27).astype(np.float32)
policies, values = predictor.predict_batch(states)

print(f"Policies: {policies.shape}")  # Shape: (4, 9)
print(f"Values: {values.shape}")      # Shape: (4,)

# Reload model (KataGo-style updates)
predictor.reload_model("models/updated_model.pt")
```

### Phase 4: Parallel Batch Generation

```python
import mcts_cpp

# Create predictor (can be RandomPredictor or TorchScript model)
predictor = mcts_cpp.RandomPredictor()

# Create batch generator with 8 threads
generator = mcts_cpp.BatchGenerator(predictor, num_threads=8)

# Generate 100 games in parallel
batch = generator.generate_batch(
    num_games=100,
    num_simulations=50,
    temperature=1.0,
    add_noise=True
)

print(f"Generated {len(batch.experiences)} experiences")
print(f"Games: {batch.total_games}")
print(f"P1 wins: {batch.player1_wins}, P2 wins: {batch.player2_wins}, Draws: {batch.draws}")

# Update predictor during training (KataGo-style)
new_predictor = mcts_cpp.RandomPredictor()  # Or load updated model
generator.update_predictor(new_predictor)

# Continue generating with new predictor
batch2 = generator.generate_batch(num_games=100)
```

**Benchmark Results** (100 games, 10 MCTS sims/move):
- Sequential: ~20,000 games/sec
- Parallel (8 threads): ~90,000 games/sec
- **Speedup: 4.5x**
```

### Phase 5: Hybrid Training Loop

```python
from trainer.train_self_play import TicTacToeNet
from trainer.train_hybrid import train_hybrid

# Create model
model = TicTacToeNet()

# Run hybrid training
history = train_hybrid(
    model=model,
    total_games=10000,        # Total self-play games
    games_per_iteration=256,  # Games per iteration
    batch_size=128,           # Mini-batch size
    train_steps_per_iteration=10,  # Training steps per iteration
    num_simulations=50,       # MCTS simulations
    num_threads=8,            # C++ threads
    lr=0.001,                 # Learning rate
    device='cpu',             # or 'cuda'
    checkpoint_dir='models/hybrid',
    save_every=1000           # Save every N games
)

# history contains training statistics
print(f"Final loss: {history['total_loss'][-1]}")
print(f"Games played: {history['total_games'][-1]}")
```

**Quick Test** (verify pipeline works):
```bash
python scripts/test_hybrid_training.py
# Runs 100 games in ~0.1 seconds
# âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED
```

**Full Training** (10k games in ~1-2 minutes):
```bash
python src/trainer/train_hybrid.py
```

## Optional Enhancements

Now that all 5 phases are complete, you can optionally:

- **Add LibTorch**: Real neural network inference in C++ for even faster self-play
- **GPU Acceleration**: Use CUDA for neural network forward pass
- **Virtual Loss**: Parallel MCTS tree search within a single game
- **Larger Games**: Support for 5x5, 6x6, or Connect-4
- **Distributed Training**: Multiple machines generating self-play data
- **Advanced MCTS**: Add noise tuning, temperature scheduling, etc.

## Architecture

Follows the **KataGo pattern**:
- C++ handles computationally intensive self-play with NN inference
- Python handles neural network training with PyTorch
- Efficient data exchange via pybind11
- Persistent C++ engine with model weight updates (no recreation overhead)

## Performance Target

Expected speedup: **10-100x** for self-play generation compared to pure Python implementation.
